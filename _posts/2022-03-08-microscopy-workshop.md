## Online hackathon for human ex-vivo microscopy

The goal of this set of events is to introduce the BICCN human ex vivo MRI and 
microscopy datasets, involve the relevant communities to develop and explore 
scientific ideas, create tooling around these and future datasets to make it 
easy, and plan towards development of an online, digital, cellular atlas and 
knowledge base of the human brain. 

Date/Time: April 21 - 22, 2022. 9am - 6pm ET

Online: Link will be sent to registered participants.

### Agenda for the hackathon

The events will run 9 - 6 ET to accommodate multiple time zones. People are welcome to join at any time.

Day 1: April 21, 2022 (9 - 6 ET)

-  DANDI+Microscopy Starter Kit: We will generate a set Starter Kit that makes it easy for users to navigate these and other Dandisets, including easier visualization of individual files.

- Dandiset Abstraction Layer: 
    - Create a set of scripts to make it easy to programmatically access these Dandisets 
    - Be able to view and compute on them.

Unconference session (11.30 - 12.30 ET)

Day 2: April 22, 2022 (9 - 6 ET)

- Visualization/Annotation: 
    - Develop a visualization of a single slab or a set of related chunks
    - Develop the steps to annotate using NeuroTrAle

- Registration:
    - Develop scripts to register lightsheet data to MRI at different scales

Unconference session (11.30 - 12.30 ET)
