      <p>The DANDI platform is supported by the <a href="https://braininitiative.nih.gov/" target="_blank">
        BRAIN Initiative</a> for publishing, sharing, and processing neurophysiology data.
        The archive accepts cellular neurophysiology data including electrophysiology, 
        optophysiology, and behavioral time-series, and images from immunostaining experiments. The 
        platform is now available for data upload and distribution. The storage of data in the archive
        is also supported by the <a href="https://registry.opendata.aws/" target=""_blank">Amazon Opendata
