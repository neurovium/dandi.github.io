# Why DANDI?

As an exercise, let's assume you lose all the data in your lab. What would you
want from the archive? Our hope is that your answer to this question, the
necessary data and metadata that you need, is at least what we should be storing.

DANDI provides:

1. A cloud-based platform to store, process, and disseminate data. You can use 
   DANDI to collaborate and publish datasets.
2. Open access to data to enable secondary uses of data outside the intent 
   of the study.
3. Optimize data storage and access through partnerships, compression and 
   accessibility technologies.
4. Enables reproducible practices and publications through data standards such 
   as NWB and BIDS, which provide extensive metadata.
5. The platform is not just an endpoint to dump data, it is intended as a living
   repository that enables collaboration within and across labs, and for others,
   the entry point for research.
